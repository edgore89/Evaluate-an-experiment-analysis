1) The flaw for this experiment with two slogans is the sample. If they intend two recruit more people to join the dark side, then the sample group should not be 50 captured droids. The amount of 50 is okay, but trying to recruit from a groups of droids that are being held captive against their will is not ideal. The hate speech would work better because they are angry. In order to obtain better results, it would be best to use a sample of random people to avoide biased results.

2) The flaw in this experiment is that if they are trying to convince people not to have hatred towards the Jedi, then they should either send two people that are not JEDI or two people that are Jedi. Of course the person that is not a Jedi will have more favorable results, but that does entitle that person to be a representative of the Jedi Council. I would instead use the same experiment, but send to Jedi to these planets and then determine who should be the representative after comparing the results.

3) The flaw in this experiment is that we are comparing job satisfaction between these two positions, but theyre are not evenly disributed among the worksites. It would be best to focus on two or three areas speficically and then ask about the job satisfaction to get more accurate mean values.

4) This experiment would be better if they gave users the option to opt in or opt out and then determine the amount pof usage from the users after installing the app. Also, they should check the amount of usage maybe after a week to see if the usage time remains the same or declines after some time.


5) There are many flaws in the experiment. Instead of making three versions, I would make two versions and randomly distribute version A  to one half of the class and Version B to the other half. Once the students are done, I would compare the results to determine which test easier or harder. Or we could also use two versions among two different classes and see which class had better test results. The problem could have been that students that are better at the subject were the ones that obtained version B while everyone else got version A or C.
