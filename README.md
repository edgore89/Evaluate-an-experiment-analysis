# Evaluate-an-experiment-analysis
1) The flaw for this experiment with two slogans is the sample. If they intend two recruit more people to join the dark side, then the sample group should not be 50 captured droids. The amount of 50 is okay, but trying to recruit from a groups of droids that are being held captive against their will is not ideal. The hate speech would work better because they are angry. In order to obtain better results, it would be best to use a sample of random people to avoide biased results.

2) The flaw in this experiment is that if they are trying to convince people not to have hatred towards the Jedi, then they should either send two people that are not JEDI or two people that are Jedi. Of course the person that is not a Jedi will have more favorable results, but that does entitle that person to be a representative of the Jedi Council. I would instead use the same experiment, but send to Jedi to these planets and then determine who should be the representative after comparing the results.
